Here is an example of redundancy for your reference.

"if immediately after else"

else {
}if(){

Solution: simplify as else if(){

"for statement with 0 or 1 iterations"

for(int i=0;i<1;i++){	

Solution: remove unnecessary for statements

"if statement with no need for conditional branching"
	
if (a>0){
}else if (a<=0){	

Solution: remove unnecessary conditional branching

"if statement not to be reached"

(if variable is defined as 0 or greater)
if (a>0){
}else if (a<=0){	

Solution: Remove unreachable conditional branches

"Excessive for statement".	

(when 10 iterations are sufficient as a problem)
for(int i=0;i<100;i++){	

Solution: shorten the number of iterations

"Repeated addition"

y=x+x+x	

Solution: Summarize as y=x*3

Redundant arithmetic	

1*x, x/x , x-x	

Solution: simplify

"Duplicate statement"
	
System.out.println("Hello!");
System.out.println("Hello!");
System.out.println("Hello!"); System.out.println("Hello!");	

Solution: use a for statement

"Duplicate calculation"; System.out.print("Hello!"); System.out.print("Hello!")

System.out.println("Total is "+a+b"); System.out.
System.out.println("The average is "+(a+b)/n);")	

Solution: use variables to reduce duplication

"Unused variables "

int x = 2, y = 1;
System.out.println(x);	

Proposed solution: remove variable declarations
